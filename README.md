In this project, we have made a classification using a Colorectal Histology MNIST Dataset consisting of 8 different types of tissues taken from colorectal cancer patients. We have used deep learning models to make this classification. We have made classification with four different CNN models and compare their results. We have calculated accuracy using the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions to evaluate the success of the classification.
